                    The user interface of the app consists of two main parts. The sidebar menu 
                    on the left side, and the page content on the right side.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The sidebar menu contains the following options:
                </p>
                <code>Dashboard</code>
                <code>Scoring</code>
                <code>Statistics</code>
                <code>Settings</code>
                <code>Quit</code>

                <p>
                    To start your practice section, select Scoring from the menu.

                <p>
                    Currently there is only one mode in the app, and that is the scoring mode. 
                    It allows you to store your throws, while showing some key statistics during your 
                    practice sessions. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    There are three separate entry fields for each throw. That means, you enter the score
                    of each dart, rather than the sum of them. When entering the score, the following apply:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Only valid score can be entered</li>
                    <li>Whitespaces are not allowed</li>
                    <li>Except for the special prefixes and entries, only numbers are allowed</li>
                    <li>Prefixes are case-insensitive</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    The following is a list of the special prefixes and entries:                    
                </p>
                <code>
                    "D" - double (usage: D16)
                    "T" - triple (usage: T20)
                    "B" - bouncer (usage: B)
                    "25" - bull (usage: 25)
                    "50" - bullseye (usage: 50)
                    "0" - no score (usage: 0)
                    "R" - robin hood (usage: R)
                </code>
                <p>
                    With the Submit button, you can submit your score. It will be then added to the throw 
                    history table next to the entry fields. 
                    If a non-valid score is entered, it will be shown in red and the score won't be 
                    submitted until all scores are valid.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Should the score be incorrectly submitted, you can double click on the 
                    corresponding row in the throw history table, and edit the incorrect entry. 
                <p>
                    The following statistics are shown during the practice sessions:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>3-dart-average</li>
                    <li>Nr. of darts thrown so far</li>
                    <li>Score so far</li>
                    <li>Current maximum score</li>
                    <li>Ratio of trebleless visits</li>
                </ul>
