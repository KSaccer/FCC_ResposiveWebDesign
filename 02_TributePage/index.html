                Zsigmond Móricz (1879-1942) was one of the most significant and influential 
                writers in 20th-century Hungarian literature. His work focused on the realistic 
                depiction of the lives of ordinary people and societal injustices. His most 
                famous works, such as "Be Faithful Unto Death" and "Relatives," 
                delve into the depths of human emotions and behavior while also highlighting 
                contemporary social issues. Móricz had a substantial impact on the development 
                of Hungarian prose, and his writings remain relevant to this day. His body 
                of work is an integral part of the Hungarian literary canon and has greatly 
                influenced later generations of writers.
